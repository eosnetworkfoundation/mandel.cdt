# EOSIO.CDT (Contract Development Toolkit)

EOSIO.CDT is a toolchain for WebAssembly (WASM) and set of tools to facilitate smart contract development for the EOSIO platform. In addition to being a general purpose WebAssembly toolchain, [Mandel](https://github.com/eosnetworkfoundation/mandel) specific optimizations are available to support building EOSIO smart contracts.  This new toolchain is built around [Clang 9](https://github.com/eosnetworkfoundation/cdt-llvm), which means that EOSIO.CDT has the most currently available optimizations and analyses from LLVM, but as the WASM target is still considered experimental, some optimizations are incomplete or not available.

## Upgrading

There's been a round of braking changes, if you are upgrading from an older version please read [Upgrading CDT to Mandel](./04_upgrading/eosio.cdt-to-mandel.cdt.md).
